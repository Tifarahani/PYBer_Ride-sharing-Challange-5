### Ride-sharing
> * Overview:
> Generating summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we can creat multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

* A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
### Overview of the analysis:
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
### Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

#### The following line chart shows the total fare by city type from January to April 2019

### Summary:
Based on the results:
- The correlation between the drivers force, the number of rides and the average fare price is not clear so additional analysis including geographic size, travel distances, cellphone coverage would be needed to get a clearer picture.
- Suburban drivers were only about 17% of the total drivers but accounted for more than 30% of the total fares and just above a quarter of the rides.<br/>
- Additional analysis including geographic size, population and social conditions, travel distances would be interesting to dive in:<br/>
- On the scatter plot, we notice some urban cities with low number of drivers and low average fare but pretty high count of rides. Analyzing the average number of drivers against the population and infrastructure and economic activity in those cities would help understand those disparities.
