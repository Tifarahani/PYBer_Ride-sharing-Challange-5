###  A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type


### Overview of the analysis:
Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
### Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The total fare by city type

#### The following line chart shows the total fare by city type from January to April 2019

### Summary:
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- In the most underserved neighborhoods, PyBer ride-sharing services would not be the first option for travels as the fares are pretty high.<br/>
The correlation between the drivers force, the number of rides and the average fare price is not clear so additional analysis including geographic size, travel distances, cellphone coverage would be needed to get a clearer picture.
- Suburban drivers were only about 17% of the total drivers but accounted for more than 30% of the total fares and just above a quarter of the rides.<br/>
Improving access to PyBer service in those areas will imply finding the right balance between incentives for more riders to join in and the right fare charge that will motivates riders to pick PyBer app as the first choice for their travels.<br/>
Additional analysis including geographic size, population and social conditions, travel distances would be interesting to dive in.<br/>
- The general tendencies is high number of drivers and rides goes with medium to low fare.<br/>
On the scatter plot, we notice some urban cities with low number of drivers and low average fare but pretty high count of rides. Analyzing the average number of drivers against the population and infrastructure and economic activity in those cities would help understand those disparities.
